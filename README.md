#Primary Logo
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise logo has two componentsâ€”the Element symbol and our word mark. The primary logo is our first choice and should be used on all communications wherever possible. Never alter the spacing, relative size or orientation of the logo. To maintain consistent use and ensure the integrity of the logo, use only the approved electronic art files.

##Clear Space
Clear space protects our logo by giving it a minimum of breathing room. Be sure that the clear space around the logo is equal to at least half the height of the logo itself. Keep clear space free of any text, graphic elements or visual marks.

Clear space may be adjusted for select online and exterior signage applications where space is limited. Please obtain global brand approval before adjusting the clear space in these types of situations.
